Folder: CS673_EX2.3 found in link:
https://mega.nz/folder/S9s3yZQJ#1LnSyiepW9Iku0cz4Dcq8Q

In this folder CS673_EX2.3, I have saved the results for:
- Maestro training (10 epochs): MAESTRO_results (20 epochs) folder
- Drums training (20 epochs): GrooveDRUM_results (20 epochs) folder

In each of these two folders, the .wav audio outputs are saved within the "outputs" folder.

I have included the Drums Dataset and the soundfonts for both 
MAESTRO and Drums training (piano.sf2 and drums.sf2, respectively).
